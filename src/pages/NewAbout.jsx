        A little about me, I was born in April 2005 in Canada, with a Taiwanese, Korean background. I can speak English, Chinese, and Iâ€™m currently learning Japanese at the N5 level. In my free time, I like to develop fun side projects through the power of code, draw, cook different recipes, watch anime, play sports, and listen to music. My favorite genres in music are VGM, JPOP, KPOP, and jazz. 
        <br/><br/>
        In the future I hope that I can help connect people and make people happy!
